DBs

Table: base unit of info
Record: row - individual item
Field: inidivual attribute
Database: collection of tables
Relational DB: most useful objs have similar info, when complex questions are being asked about the data

SQL: lang for querying/creating/updating relational databases//english-like (SELECT color, PRICE FROM melons)//whitespace insignificant//case insensitive. SQL keywords are caps (convention)


VARCHAR(n): defined num of chars in str
FLOAT: up to 15 dec places
BOOLEAN: TRUE or FALSE

create table, we declare which data type a column will have as well as constraints (not null, etc)
info has to match format

select statement query but don't change the databases
use FROM and WHERE to get raw data under certain condition (SELECT id FROM melon WHERE color==green )
match any string LIKE "StartsWith%"
BETWEEN
IN (1,2,3)
group by will group results together
offset - how many rows to skip starting from top 

update: change values in the field of a table//does not change structure of table
delete is permanent// be careful
