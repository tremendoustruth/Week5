3) Which companies have the most franchise units (non-company-owned units)?
4) Which companies have the most locations combined (franchise + company owned)?Â¶
5) Which companies have the highest revenue per unit?
6) Is there a correlation between the amount of sales per company and the company's total number of locations?

Further Questions and Notes:
-How do business objectives align with customer needs?
-How does location impact sales/revenue?
-How would increasing the price per unit impact revenue, total units sold, etc.

Rule of Data Analytics: Must analyze the data without changing the meaning of it. 
"If you torture the data long enough, it will confess to anything."
Must communicate meaning with integrity, must find appropriate answers for well-defined questions.
Don't forget to "understand the audience."
